# Bash-programs
This is a repository I will be uploading my BASH programs to as I learn to program shell programs. 

* Note: Some programs might not work because they are meant for specific things on my computer. 

## Files that will only work for me:
* navi -> It opens folder paths that only exist on my pc
* notes.sh -> I use this to test out new commands I learn

## Running the programs: 

To make a file executable anywhere:
First make it executable:
> chmod +x filename 

Then run:
> sudo cp filename /usr/local/bin/
